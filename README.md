# Madden Stats

The goal of this project was to build a full stack application from start to finish. This is the frontend, while the backend repository can be found at https://github.com/vjohnson22/madden_app_backend. My app is designed to track the statistics from user vs user games in a Madden 20 (for video game on Playstation 4) league that I have with several college friends. I created this application because the statistics captured on the game do not specifically track user vs user games, and I wanted to do visualizations using Charts.js, as well as some more complex backend queries (coming soon)
